My solution to the first problem of project euler

## Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5

**The Problem:** Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

**The Strategy:** Instead of checking every number one by one, I used a mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. This makes the code much faster, especially for larger numbers.

**Logic:** Total = (Sum of multiples of 3) + (Sum of multiples of 5) - (Sum of multiples of 15)
